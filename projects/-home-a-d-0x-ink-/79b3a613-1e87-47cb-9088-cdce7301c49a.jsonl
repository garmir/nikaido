High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the \"big picture\" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand.\n\nUsage notes:\n- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.\n- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like \"Provide helpful error messages to users\", \"Write unit tests for all new utilities\", \"Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits\".\n- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.\n- Don't include generic development practices.\n- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.\n- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.\n- Do not make up information such as \"Common Development Tasks\", \"Tips for Development\", \"Support and Documentation\" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.\n- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:\n\n```\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n```"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"2a366325-5d92-4820-bdbb-b08ad2ecf266","timestamp":"2025-09-19T05:09:19.911Z"}

Environment Setup (MANDATORY)\n    72→- **ALWAYS** start with `cd ~` to avoid \"no shell.nix\" errors\n    73→- **MUST** include both `nodejs` and `expect` in nix-shell packages\n    74→- **USE** `--run` flag to execute within nix-shell environment\n    75→- **NEVER** try to pipe input directly (causes \"raw mode not supported\" errors)\n    76→\n    77→### 2. Claude Code Flags\n    78→- **REQUIRED**: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag\n    79→- **NOTE**: This flag alone doesn't bypass all prompts - expect handles the rest\n    80→- **DO NOT** use `-p` print flag - it doesn't bypass interaction requirements\n    81→\n    82→### 3. Expect Automation Pattern\n    83→```tcl\n    84→expect {\n    85→  -re {.*bypass permissions.*} {    # Match the permissions warning\n    86→    send \"2\\r\"                       # Send option 2 (accept)\n    87→    exp_continue                     # Continue matching\n    88→  }\n    89→  -re {.*SUCCESS_PATTERN.*} {       # Match task completion\n    90→    exit 0                           # Exit successfully\n    91→  }\n    92→  timeout {                          # Handle timeout\n    93→    exit 1                           # Exit with error\n    94→  }\n    95→}\n    96→```\n    97→\n    98→### 4. Quote Escaping Hierarchy\n    99→1. **Outer**: Single quotes for bash -c\n   100→2. **Middle**: Double quotes for expect script\n   101→3. **Inner**: Escaped double quotes (\\\\\") for Claude Code prompt\n   102→4. **Deepest**: Triple-escaped (\\\\\\\\\\\\\") for nested strings in Ghostty\n   103→\n   104→## Task-Specific Templates\n   105→\n   106→### SSH Connection Tasks (Enhanced with Error Handling)\n   107→```bash\n   108→# Robust SSH connection with comprehensive error handling\n   109→nix-shell -p expect openssh --run \"expect -c '\n   110→set timeout 30\n   111→set max_retries 3\n   112→set retry_count 0\n   113→\n   114→proc handle_ssh_error {error_msg} {\n   115→  global retry_count max_retries\n   116→  send_user \\\"SSH Error: \\$error_msg\\\\n\\\"\n   117→  incr retry_count\n   118→  if {\\$retry_count <= \\$max_retries} {\n   119→    send_user \\\"Retrying SSH connection (attempt \\$retry_count/\\$max_retries)...\\\\n\\\"\n   120→    sleep 2\n   121→    return 1\n   122→  } else {\n   123→    send_user \\\"Max retries exceeded.

It provides production-grade patterns for non-interactive execution of Claude Code instances with comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and validation mechanisms.\n\n## Core Methodology: Automated Agent Distribution\n\nWhen you need to execute tasks using automated Claude Code agents, follow this exact methodology for non-interactive execution with robust error handling.\n\n### The Enhanced Master Command Pattern\n\n```bash\ncd ~ && nix-shell -p nodejs expect --run 'expect -c \"\nset timeout 60\nset max_retries 3\nset retry_count 0\n\nproc retry_spawn {} {\n  global retry_count max_retries\n  incr retry_count\n  if {$retry_count > $max_retries} {\n    send_user \\\"Max retries ($max_retries) exceeded\\\\n\\\"\n    exit 1\n  }\n  send_user \\\"Retry attempt $retry_count of $max_retries\\\\n\\\"\n  spawn npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code --dangerously-skip-permissions \\\"[YOUR TASK HERE]\\\"\n}\n\nspawn npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code --dangerously-skip-permissions \\\"[YOUR TASK HERE]\\\"\n\nexpect {\n  -re {.*bypass permissions.*} {\n    send \\\"2\\r\\\"\n    exp_continue\n  }\n  -re {.*created.*|.*written.*|.*saved.*|.*completed.*} {\n    exit 0\n  }\n  -re {Connection refused|Connection closed|Connection reset} {\n    send_user \\\"Connection error: $expect_out(buffer)\\\\n\\\"\n    retry_spawn\n    exp_continue\n  }\n  eof {\n    send_user \\\"Unexpected EOF encountered\\\\n\\\"\n    if {$retry_count < $max_retries} {\n      retry_spawn\n      exp_continue\n    } else {\n      exit 1\n    }\n  }\n  timeout {\n    send_user \\\"Timeout after $timeout seconds\\\\n\\\"\n    if {$retry_count < $max_retries} {\n      retry_spawn\n      exp_continue\n    } else {\n      exit 1\n    }\n  }\n}\n\"'\n```\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### 1. Environment Setup (MANDATORY)\n- **ALWAYS** start with `cd ~` to avoid \"no shell.nix\" errors\n- **MUST** include both `nodejs` and `expect` in nix-shell packages\n- **USE** `--run` flag to execute within nix-shell environment\n- **NEVER** try to pipe input directly (causes \"raw mode not supported\" errors)\n\n### 2. Claude Code Flags\n- **REQUIRED**: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag\n- **NOTE**: This flag alone doesn't bypass all prompts - expect handles the rest\n- **DO NOT** use `-p` print flag - it doesn't bypass interaction requirements\n\n### 3. Expect Automation Pattern\n```tcl\nexpect {\n  -re {.*bypass permissions.*} {    # Match the permissions warning\n    send \"2\\r\"                       # Send option 2 (accept)\n    exp_continue                     # Continue matching\n  }\n  -re {.*SUCCESS_PATTERN.*} {       # Match task completion\n    exit 0                           # Exit successfully\n  }\n  timeout {                          # Handle timeout\n    exit 1                           # Exit with error\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Quote Escaping Hierarchy\n1. **Outer**: Single quotes for bash -c\n2. **Middle**: Double quotes for expect script\n3. **Inner**: Escaped double quotes (\\\\\") for Claude Code prompt\n4. **Deepest**: Triple-escaped (\\\\\\\\\\\\\") for nested strings in Ghostty\n\n## Task-Specific Templates\n\n### SSH Connection Tasks (Enhanced with Error Handling)\n```bash\n# Robust SSH connection with comprehensive error handling\nnix-shell -p expect openssh --run \"expect -c '\nset timeout 30\nset max_retries 3\nset retry_count 0\n\nproc handle_ssh_error {error_msg} {\n  global retry_count max_retries\n  send_user \\\"SSH Error: \\$error_msg\\\\n\\\"\n  incr retry_count\n  if {\\$retry_count <= \\$max_retries} {\n    send_user \\\"Retrying SSH connection (attempt \\$retry_count/\\$max_retries)...\\\\n\\\"\n    sleep 2\n    return 1\n  } else {\n    send_user \\\"Max retries exceeded.

The system deliberately bypasses permission controls to enable automation, creating significant security implications.\n\n## System Overview\nThe methodology enables automated, non-interactive execution of Claude Code AI agents through:\n- **TTY Emulation**: Using `expect` to simulate terminal interaction\n- **Permission Bypass**: Using `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag\n- **Process Orchestration**: Managing multiple parallel agent instances\n- **Network Operations**: Including SSH connections with embedded credentials\n\n## STRIDE Analysis\n\n### S - Spoofing (Identity)\n\n#### Threats\n1. **Impersonation of Claude Code Agent**\n   - **Risk**: High\n   - **Description**: Malicious processes could masquerade as legitimate Claude Code agents\n   - **Attack Vector**: Process name spoofing, fake npx packages\n   - **Impact**: Execution of unauthorized code with Claude Code privileges\n\n2. **SSH Identity Spoofing**\n   - **Risk**: Critical\n   - **Description**: Hard-coded credentials (`a@192.168.50.6`, `LizardState!!777`) exposed in plaintext\n   - **Attack Vector**: Credential harvesting from scripts, logs, or process arguments\n   - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to SSH targets\n\n3. **Man-in-the-Middle on NPX Download**\n   - **Risk**: Medium\n   - **Description**: NPX downloads packages without signature verification\n   - **Attack Vector**: DNS hijacking, malicious npm registry\n   - **Impact**: Execution of trojanized Claude Code packages\n\n#### Mitigations\n- Use SSH key-based authentication instead of passwords\n- Implement process signature verification\n- Use private npm registries with package signing\n- Store credentials in secure vaults, not scripts\n\n### T - Tampering\n\n#### Threats\n1. **Command Injection via Task Parameters**\n   - **Risk**: Critical\n   - **Description**: Unvalidated task strings passed directly to spawned processes\n   - **Attack Vector**: Malicious input in `[YOUR TASK HERE]` placeholders\n   -
